# Communication Solutions

Thoughts about communication problems and potential solutions. 


**Problem:** You're long winded statements are often interrupted, ignored, or misunderstood.

**Solution:** Use questions to periodically check the status of the conversation. I'm calling this **QFC** or *Question Focused Communication* or *Question First Communication*.

**Discussion:** Even when you are 100% confident in what you want to happen or that you know the solution to a problem, the other participant(s) may not be on the same page as you. Using frequent questions to test the success of your communication attempts can help you dynamically respond to misunderstandings on both sides of a conversation.

You can take a *discovery* approach to problem solving where you ask questions first with the goal of ensuring the problem is **well defined**. Next you can collaboratively discover a solution to the problem by proposing your solution in the form of a question.

The goal of this approach is to maximize the effectiveness or quality of communication. Questions allow us to learn where the conversation currently is and adapt our approach quickly to find a better approach in the case it is failing.
