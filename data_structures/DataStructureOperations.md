# Data Structure Operations

### Priority Queue

Useful when a collection of elements needs to be ordered and processed according to some key **K**. Allows in order insertion that is more efficient than re-sorting the entire collection.

Main operations:

1. *Insert (Q, x)*
2. *Find Minumum(Q)* or *Find-Maximum(Q)*
3. *DeleteMinimum(Q)* or *DeleteMaximum(Q)*
