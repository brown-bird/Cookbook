# The Process

What steps and in what order should we proceed when working on a problem. 

### Is Everthing Well Defined?

* Are all the components / participants well defined or understood?
* Are all the necessary relationships well defined?
* Are the *acceptance* tests / criteria well defined?

### Is there an Analogous Problem?

* Has this problem been solved before? 
* Can the problem be deconstructed into smaller problems?

### Can you find out through experimentation?

* Is there a test or experiment that will give the answer?
* Can we eleminate **negative** cases?

### Insider knowledge?

* Is there something someone can clear up or confirm for us?
