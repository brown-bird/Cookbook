# Documentation

Comments in code should be high level explanations of _why_ something is done. The code itself is an explanation of the low-level _how_ it is done. Too many comments are just as bad as too few. Comments that are too tightly coupled to implementation details will likely become out of date very fast and either need to be updated regularly or worse get out of sync.
