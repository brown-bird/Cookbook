#### Nested static classes:
* can be accessed outside of the inner class (if public)
* have no access to instance variables of the enclosing class
	* must be passed in via method or constructor parameters
* Don't make sense if private?
 
 
#### Inner Classes:
* Cannot exist without an enclosing instance
* Do have access to instance variables
