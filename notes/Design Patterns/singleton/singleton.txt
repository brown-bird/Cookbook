Singleton pattern notes

Usages:
Thread pools, caches, dialog boxes, objects that handle preferences and registry settings, objects used for logging, and objects that act as device drivers to devices like printers and graphics cards.

Problem it solves: 
incorrect behavior with multiple instances, overuse of resources, and inconsistent results. 

Questions to consider:
 1. Will more than one instance of this class cause problems?
 2. Will more than one instance of this class unnecessarily overburden a resource? i.e. a cache could cut back on resource usage. 
 
Problems it causes:
A. Testing multiple instances of a class which is a client of or contains a singleton as a member suffers from coupling through the singleton.
B. To test properly, singleton must maintain a backdoor (i.e. not intended for use other than testing) to either create additional instances or mutator methods to break static dependencies. 
C. All member classes are transiently global. 
D. A singleton with state is essentially a global variable. This breaks the OO principle of encapsulation. 
E. Different threads accessing a singleton can end up with different instances. i.e. a race condition. 
F. Multiple Class Loaders can lead to more than one instance of a singleton.

Solving synchronization:
1. Use the "synchronized" keyword, however synchronization is expensive and only needed the very first time the instance is set. If calling getInstance is not a high frequency call in the application using this method can preserve the lazy instantiation of the uniqueInstance and may be suitable. 

//synchronization example
public class Singleton
{
	private static Singleton uniqueInstance;
	
	private Singleton(){}
	
	public static synchonized Singleton getInstance()
	{
		if (uniqueInstance == null)
		{
			uniqueInstance = new Singleton();
		}
		return uniqueInstance;
	}
}

2. Eagerly create the instance. Preferable if getInstance will be called frequently and the overhead of synchronization would be detrimental. 

// eager instatiation example
public class Singleton
{
	private static Singleton uniqueInstance = new Singleton();
	
	private Singleton(){}
	
	public static Singleton getInstance()
	{
		return uniqueInstance;
	}
}

3. Double-Checked locking. Check for an instance first and then synchonize the instantiation. This avoids synchronizing on every call of getInstance, synchronizing only on the first call. Mind the use of the "volatile" keyword. double-checked locking only works in java 1.5 or later.

//synchronization example
public class Singleton
{
	private volatile static Singleton uniqueInstance;
	
	private Singleton(){}
	
	public static Singleton getInstance()
	{
		if (uniqueInstance == null)
		{
			synchonized(Singleton.class)
			{
				if (uniqueInstance == null)
					uniqueInstance = new Singleton();
			}
		}
		return uniqueInstance;
	}
}
