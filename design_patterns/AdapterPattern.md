# Adapter Pattern

The Adapter Pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface the clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

The Adapter is a concrete class that delegates the calls of client code, which depends on an interface, to a concrete class which doesn't directly implement that interface.
