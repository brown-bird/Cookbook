# Static Classes and Methods

**Perceived benefit:**

1. Code reuse

**Trade-Offs**:

1. Tight Coupling
2. Hidden dependencies
3. No Polymorphism

Static utility classes and methods make it more work to use polymorphism and thus change or add behavior through interfaces and instances. Static methods give the illusion that a class has fewer dependencies than it actually does.
