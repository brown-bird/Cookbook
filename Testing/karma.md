a.k.a. Testacular

###Features:

1. Starts via the command line with `karma Start`. The config file that Karma needs can be generated via `karma init`. Some automation tools such as "grunt" may not require the config file. 
2. Watches the current directory and runs all tests on save.
3. Tests in a real browser in the background.
4. Can run tests in multiple browsers. Register a new browser or device by connnecting to the server port via the address bar.
