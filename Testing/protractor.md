# Protractor Testing

**Problem:** Run protractor tests

**Solution:** Ensure that your app is being served. If it is not, run `npm start` to begin http-server. Run your protractor tests with `npm run protractor`. You may need to install protractor with `npm install` and update the webdriver with `npm run update-webdriver` prior to running.
