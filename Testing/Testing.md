- Singleton in the Way
- Not enough time to Get Existing Code Under Test
- I Don't Understand It Well Enough to Test


## Legacy Code Problems

### Singleton in the Way

* Parameterize Constructor
* Parameterize Method
* Extract and Override Call
* Subclass and Override
* Static Setter Method
* Extract Interface + Lean on the Compiler

### Not enough time to Get Existing Code Under Test 

* Sprout Method / Sprout Class
* Wrap Method / Wrap Class

### I Don't Understand It Well Enough to Test

* Characterization Tests
