#Git Glossary

**Head** - This is a pointer to the local branch you are currently on.  

**Fast-Forward** - A simplified merge when the commit your merging is directly ahead of the current 
commit you are pointing to. 

**Three Snapshot merge** - Merging branches with divergent histories. 
The typical merge of a feature branch back into master is of this type. Git creates a new commit
with multiple parents.
