# Java 8 Streams 
*STRAMS* for those in the know ;)

__Note:__ Streams in Java 8 are not the same things as `InputStream` and `OutputStream` from Java I/O.

### Stream Operations
- reduce
- collect
- flatMap
 
Stream Operations are either __intermediate__ or __terminal__. Intermediate operations return a stream and can be chained. Terminal operations are either void or return a non-stream result.
